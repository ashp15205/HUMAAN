# 💚 HuMaan - AI-Powered Mental Health Support for Students

**HuMaan** is an AI-driven mental health support system designed specifically for students. With increasing academic pressures like assignments, exams, and practicals — alongside unhealthy habits such as irregular sleep and poor nutrition — students often experience a decline in both mental and physical well-being.

This project introduces an AI-integrated platform that provides personalized mental health support to help students manage stress, reduce anxiety, and promote healthier lifestyles. Over time, these small yet consistent improvements contribute to long-term emotional stability and personal growth.
